Dr Lingyu Wang is a tenured senior scientist at the Netherlands Institute for Space Research (SRON), an assistant professor at the University of Groningen (RUG), and a Rosalind Franklin Fellow at RUG. Her research interests are in the area of galaxy formation and evolution from the local Universe to the limits of our current observing capabilities. How galaxies change (in terms of their stellar mass, star-formation rate, dust content, morphology, the accretion rate and mass of the supermassive black holes they host, etc.) over cosmic time? What are the physical processes driving these changes? How can we compare observations and theoretical predictions in a meaningful way?
