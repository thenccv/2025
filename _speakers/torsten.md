Dr Torsten Sattler is a senior researcher at the Czech Institute of Informatics, Robotics and Cybernetics (CIIRC) at the Czech Technical University in Prague (CTU), where he is heading the Spatial Intelligence group. His research interests include (large-scale) image-based localization, real-time localization, 3D mapping and reconstruction, implicit neural scene representations and neural rendering, learning local features, machine learning for 3D computer vision, and camera calibration, with applications in self-driving cars and other autonomous robots as well as augmented and virtual reality. His current work focuses on making algorithms for localization and mapping "smarter" (and thus more robust and reliable) by incorporating higher-level scene understanding into the process.
