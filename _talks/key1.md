Generative AI is transforming visual media, enabling stunning 2D synthesis and opening new frontiers in 3D content creation. Yet with realism comes risk, as deepfakes blur the line between real and fake. This talk explores two critical challenges at the heart of generative visual AI: advancing controllable 3D generation for creative and industrial use, and developing robust methods to detect manipulated media. These efforts reflect a key goal of our time: using generative AI to support creativity and innovation, while protecting the authenticity and reliability of what we see.
